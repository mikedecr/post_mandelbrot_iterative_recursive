    The Mandelbrot Set with Iterative and Recursive Approaches
# excerpt: |
#     A blogdown website is more like a combination of modular components that are better managed independently, each component with its own repository.
#     These modular components _come together_ at the nexus of the website, but the components do not _belong to_ the website.

# Overview

One fun lessons in the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html)[^sicp] is the translation of functions between _iterative_ and _recursive_ approaches.
Take raising a number to a particular (integer) power.
We could implement such a procedure with iterative multiplication using a loop...

```{r}
# this won't work for every p
pow_iter = function(x, p) { 
    if (p == 1) { return(x) }
    result = x
    for (i in 2:p) {
       result = result * x 
    } 
    return(result)
}
```

... or as a recursive procedure that accumulates a tree of calls to a `square` function.

```{r}
pow_rec = function(x, p) {
    if (p == 1) { return(x) }
    x * pow_rec(x, p - 1)
}
```
